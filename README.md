Creating a Repository

Hello! I'm Lily, someone who enjoys an exciting time outdoors when I'm not tinkering with tech and art. 
I'm looking forward to expanding my GitHub knowledge. Currently English, French, C++, Python, and MatLAB are the languages I speak. Fluency is a goal for the latter 4. 

Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are fascinating to me right now, as is learning the basics of AI (thanks MNIST!) 

P.S. Hubot seems like a great bean
